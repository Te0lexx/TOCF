                You're in a Saint Denis, it's 4am, gloomy and desolate,
                you can hear your own footsteps of your tuxedo shoes along the cobbled alley.
                They must know by now, The Inquisition had to have found out what you had done with the bonds.
                Your wife, you must take her with you to the docks. You rush home,
                mahogany brown leather briefcase in hand, the gold plated clips all that holds your future secure.
                You stumble home looking back and forth for any sign,
                any pre-warning but they didn't do that, The Inquisition stalk and hunt,
                they prowl for the blood running through your veins, not scream for your death,
                but rather yearn for it. Silently. You're close to home now,
                you run up your apartment to the room you rented to hide the one you loved,
                you swing open the door to your apartment. You see a woman, strapped to a chair.
                You approach, eyes removed from their sockets, head back, mouth gaped by a dislocated jaw,
                no tongue, a wire wrapped around the woman's throat bulging around the neck,
                the discolouration around it, the bloody, broken nose of your soul mate laying. No.
                Sitting, limp, still twitching, periodically.
                Her finger nails removed from what were once soft delicate hands.
                Your eyes shamble up to eye level with a platinum blonde man standing just outside the window,
                staring, not a blink from the soulless pearls on his facade.
                You stumble to run out of the room, Sawned Off Shotgun in hand,
                you dart out of the door, wailing and flying down the stairs,
                you crash out of the building onto the pavement outside, a torrent of rain creating a murky puddle you land in.
                You go to drag yourself up but you feel a sharp pain in your lower back,
                your shirt feels wet underneath your dusty tail coat,
                you feel a hand hold your face in the puddle as you gasp for air hyperventilating and breathing
                in this murky water before being allowed a breath, you see yourself in the puddle,
                releasing the briefcase, as this will be a brief case of affairs after all.
                Two men pull you to your knees, you look up to see the blonde man again,
                a face of evil not even the devil could conjur, burning his stare into whatever is left of your battered soul and pride,
                you feel both your sides of your ribs burn, you loose you breath instantly as a noose slips tightly around your throat,
                you feel yourself hoisted off the ground internally screaming as there is literally no more air left in your lungs.
                With every pull and jank in your ascent blood escapes from your closetted throat into your mouth and out of your nose,
                your eyes bulge as does your veins, 
                you see less and less in your vision but still that man,
                maintaining that stare with into you, never breaking it, your eyes beg for mercy,
                his are not listening, but judging. You feel a warmth creep up your legs, your torso, your head. Aflame.
                And in the milky darkness of that yellow glow, you realise, they didn't find out, they knew everything the entire time, 
                you feel you blood droop its last drop from your sides and back. The Saint Denis police find your body within 2 hours,
                swinging in the wind, a tortured husk. Take heed this, story, it is indeed a true one, and when you hear someone come a knocking,
                and you fucked with the Oâ€™Carlins, just know, you were always prewarned.
